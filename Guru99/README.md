# Learning Machine Learning
---
## What is this repository?
This repository contains my implementations of ML algorithms. These are exercises for me to become proficient in using different API's and languages (e.g. Tensorflow, PyTorch). My "mother tongue" in programming is Python. After a while this repository might also be extended to examples in C++.

What you will read below this is my personal roadmap to becoming proficient at Machine Learning.

## What concepts I want to cover:
* RNN
* LSTM
* CNN
* GAN, DCGAN
* VAE
* DRL
* DL
* Bayesian networks
* Graph Convolutional Network, Graph Variational Autoencoder: [check it here](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Kipf%2C+T+N)
* ResNet, DenseNet

## Which frameworks I use to practice this:
* Theano (tensor computations)
* Tensorflow (mostly neural network stuff, graph based, execution in C++)
* PyTorch (similar to Tensorflow, not graph based)
* Scikit (standard machine learning, like simple classifiers)
* Keras (deep learning library)
* Pandas (data analysis, for example importing CSV files)
